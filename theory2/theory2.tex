\begin{enumerate}

\item There is little advantage to an 8 item Linked List node, unless you can
make very strong assumptions regarding the contents of the Linked List. The
advantages include reduced memory allocations, which can be quite slow, and
an ability to proceed through a list in units of 8, particularly if you're able
to ignore the contents of the array inside each node.

The disadvantages include substantially increased complexity, an inability to
trivially rearrange the linked list.

It only seems to make sense if you always have sets of 8, in which case it's
really a normal Linked List with each object being an 8-tuple.
